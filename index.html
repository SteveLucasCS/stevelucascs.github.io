            From homeland security, to economics, then mechanical engineering, I finally ended up in the expansive
            field computer science. Through all of my interests, there have been important constants, which define who
            I am today. My biggest passion in life is learning, and I believe my biggest strength is my growth mindset.
            I thrive when I can be creative and solve problems; a job that engages my brain is a must for me. When I
            have a challenge to overcome or an opportunity exercise my creativity, I have an incredible drive and
            determination. Engaging tasks are not"work" to me; creative problem solving is the most fulfilling activity
            in my life. When I get into a project, I will not stop until I am satisfied that my work is as perfect as I
            can make it, and better than the work I did the day before. I strive to go above and beyond, often asking
            "why not?" instead of "why." I crave a deep understanding of the world around me, which leads to me
            studying topics such as astronomy, quantum physics, and economics in my spare time. Luckily, I also have
            more practical hobbies, such as hockey and dogs.
          </p>

            I am lucky to be an ambitious dreamer; I will always have a drive to be a better person than the day
            before. My ideal career would be developing innovative technologies that could change the world. I often
            ponder what the future holds, especially in the ways of technology. My dream is to help create devices that
            would benefit mankind, and I believe there are many opportunities emerging that can make that possible.
            With ideas such as in-home MRI machines, to the internet of things, artificial intelligence, human-machine
            integration, and countless more we cannot even fathom right now, I believe a new technological era is just
            around the corner. My goal is to be part of it, and following my ambition is how I plan to get there.
